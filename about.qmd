Hi, I'm Jack Bailey.

I'm a political scientist and Lecturer in Quantitative Politics at [the University of Manchester](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/politics/) in the UK.

My research has three aims. First, to understand [how economics affects voting behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_voting). Second, to study [how politics differs across time and space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_politics). And, third, to [improve political methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_methodology).

I've published my research in a number of different peer-reviewed journals. To read my work, check my page on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=82kKRKIAAAAJ&hl=en). Likewise, if you want to know more about me, you can find a copy of [my CV here](https://github.com/jackobailey/CV/raw/master/jack-bailey-cv.pdf).


I love communicating political science to the general public. So I'm more-or-less open to any media request you might have. To set something up, either contact [Manchester's Media Relations team](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/contact-media-relations/) or [send me an email](mailto:jack.bailey@manchester.ac.uk).
